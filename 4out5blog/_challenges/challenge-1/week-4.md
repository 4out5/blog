In the fourth week, we made significant progress in refining our project. We had direct contact with two experts, both pharmacists, which allowed us to further improve the flowchart of the system. The feedback we received from them was crucial in validating our current approach and guiding the necessary refinements. With these adjustments, we expect that by next week, we will be ready to begin working on the knowledge base, which is a core component of the expert system.

In addition to refining the flowchart, we also made advancements across all other applications. Specifically:

- **Graphical Interface**: We focused on improving the user interface of the client application, enhancing the user experience and ensuring that the design is aligned with the system's functionality.

- **Endpoint Testing**: We tested the endpoints of the client application, the server (Java Spring), and the Prolog application, ensuring that communication between the various components of the system is working as expected.
- **Inference Engine Testing**: We conducted preliminary tests with the inference engine, which is responsible for making decisions based on the rules and data in the knowledge base. These tests were essential to verify that the engine is functioning correctly and that it will be able to provide accurate medication recommendations.

The work done during this week laid a strong foundation for the next phase of development. We are now well-prepared to move forward with building the knowledge base, which will store the clinical guidelines and rules used by the system to make recommendations. As we refine the expert system, the input from pharmacists and the testing of our technical components will continue to play a key role in shaping the accuracy and effectiveness of the final product.

Next week, we aim to finalize the flowchart and begin constructing the knowledge base, while continuing to refine the systemâ€™s components based on the feedback and results from our tests.
