In the third week, the group refined the flowcharts that model the expert system's operation. We are now ready to consult with the experts about the final adjustments needed before proceeding to build the knowledge base. This knowledge base will serve as the core of the expert system, containing the rules and information necessary for recommending the most appropriate medication.

Additionally, we created the project repository, which contains all the foundational applications required for the project. These include:

- **Drools application**: This will host the expert system based on Drools, a business rules management system.
- **Prolog application**: This will contain another expert system based on Prolog, a logic programming language frequently used in artificial intelligence.
- **Java Spring server application**: This backend application will manage the system's logic and handle communications between the components.
- **React client application**: This is the frontend interface where users will interact with the system, providing data and receiving medication recommendations.

For the upcoming week, we plan to consult the experts to finalize the flowchart refinements and start building the knowledge base. Additionally, we will continue developing the listed applications and work towards integrating all the system components.
