In Week 7, we successfully wrapped up several critical aspects of our expert system, marking a significant milestone in our development process.

We finalized the knowledge base and the inference engine implementation, ensuring it comprehensively incorporates clinical guidelines and rules derived from expert input. This approach enhances the system's reasoning capabilities, allowing for effective decision-making processes.

To further improve user experience, we implemented key changes to the user interface (UI). These enhancements are designed to make the system more intuitive and accessible, allowing users to interact seamlessly with the platform.

We also conducted tests to ensure everything is functioning as intended, verifying the accuracy of the knowledge base, the inference engine, and the UI improvements. This thorough testing process confirms that the system operates smoothly and effectively.

Finally, we completed the reporting features. These include a scientific article and a comparison report that outlines the changes made to the inference engine and the knowledge base in Prolog. These reports will facilitate a clearer understanding of our work and provide insights into our development process and improvements.
