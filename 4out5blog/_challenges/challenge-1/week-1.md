In this first week of the challenge, we had the opportunity to get to know our application area, Health. It was also the week when we got to know each other and established our communication and collaboration channels, such as creating a group on Microsoft Teams, Discord, and a GitHub repository, to facilitate progress tracking, task organization, and collaborative project development.

After this initial phase of organization, we turned our attention to selecting the specific area within the broad field of health. After analyzing the involvement and expertise of each group member, we agreed that Pharmacy would be a good area to focus on due to its direct impact on people's lives and the abundance of relevant data available, such as information on medications, dosages, interactions, and pathologies. Furthermore, pharmacy is a field where decision support systems can play a crucial role, both in recommending medications and ensuring patient safety, as errors in prescription or combining medications can lead to serious health issues.

In this area, we managed to establish contact with three experts who will be essential in guiding the development of our project. These specialists will help validate the knowledge base required for the system, ensuring that it aligns with best practices in the pharmaceutical field and offers viable and safe solutions for healthcare professionals.

For the development of the expert system, we discussed two main approaches. The first idea is to create a system that suggests the correct medication for a specific treatment, based on the patient's symptoms and medical history. This system would be capable of cross-referencing information and applying specific rules to ensure an effective and personalized prescription, assisting doctors and pharmacists in selecting the best treatment.

The second proposal we analyzed was the creation of a medication interaction detection system, aimed at identifying potential adverse interactions between drugs. This system would be highly useful in preventing complications in treatments involving multiple medications, alerting healthcare professionals about possible incompatibilities and helping to safeguard patient safety.

Next week, we plan to explore both topics in greater depth and conduct more detailed research on the technologies and methodologies needed to develop these systems. Additionally, we will gather more feedback from the experts we contacted, to help us make a final decision on which of the two approaches will be most viable and impactful for this first challenge.
