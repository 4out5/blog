In the second week, the group advanced in choosing the project topic, deciding to develop an expert system to indicate the best medication for treating flu symptoms. This choice was made based on the practical relevance of the topic and the abundance of data available to support the system. After the decision was made, we had a meeting with our mentor to discuss the proposal, and the feedback we received was positive, validating our choice and guiding us for the next steps of development.

Additionally, we consulted with the professors from the PPROGIA and ENGCIA courses to obtain more technical guidance on the implementation. During these discussions, we received valuable suggestions, particularly the possibility of using certainty factors based on the pain scale for each symptom, which could improve the accuracy of the system when recommending the most appropriate medication. This approach will allow for more personalized treatment recommendations, adjusting the medication suggestion according to the severity of the symptoms reported by the patient.

As part of the first practical steps of development, we started working on the flowchart of the system. To do this, we used a document on the guidelines for the treatment of flu syndromes, provided by one of the experts we are collaborating with. This document has been essential for structuring the knowledge that will feed into the system, ensuring that the recommendations will be aligned with the most up-to-date clinical practices.

Throughout the next week, we will continue refining the flowchart and start structuring the knowledge base that will be used in the system, while applying the guidance received from professors and experts to ensure that development follows the most effective path and is aligned with the project goals.
