In Week 6, we focused on refining and optimizing the communication mechanisms within our expert system, achieving notable improvements in several technical areas.

We refined our communication protocol and further streamlined the JSON format used for interactions between the system components. This enhancement has simplified the way data is exchanged between the frontend and the Prolog server, resulting in more efficient and clear data transmission. This simplification will contribute to a smoother integration and reduce potential points of failure in the system’s architecture.

Additionally, we introduced new features to the inference engine, specifically the "why not" and "how" explanations. These additions enable the system to provide more transparency in its decision-making process, allowing users to understand not only the recommendations given but also the rationale behind rejected options. This makes the system more user-friendly and trustworthy, particularly in clinical settings where decision traceability is essential.

We have also made significant progress in populating the knowledge base, incorporating the clinical guidelines and rules derived from expert input. The rules have been redefined and optimized, ensuring they align with best practices and are now ready for final testing. This positions us well for the upcoming phase, where we will rigorously validate the system’s performance and reliability.
