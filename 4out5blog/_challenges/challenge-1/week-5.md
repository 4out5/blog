In Week 5, we continued to build on the solid foundation laid in previous weeks and made significant strides in several key areas of our expert system project.

We completed and delivered a "Prior Knowledge Acquisition Report" which outlined the methodology used to gather knowledge from our experts. This report captured the insights and guidelines we obtained, which are crucial for the development of the expert systemâ€™s knowledge base. Along with the report, we prepared and presented a formal presentation, summarizing our approach, findings, and how the system would be used in practice

Following the feedback we received last week, we presented the refined system flowchart to the experts once more. Their approval and additional recommendations were crucial in validating the direction we are taking. This confirmed that our flow of logic is aligned with real-world clinical practices, enhancing the reliability of the system. With the flowchart finalized, we are now confident in moving forward with the construction of the knowledge base.

We have officially begun the development of the system's knowledge base, which will house the clinical guidelines and rules necessary for medication advices. This component will serve as the core of the expert system, enabling the inference engine to make accurate, evidence-based decisions. We are currently inputting the information gathered from the experts.

Additionally, to ensure smooth communication between the various components of the system (client, server, Prolog, and the inference engine), we defined a standardized message format using JSON.
